# python_Todo
Consistence is the Key,    I have made a ToDo Web application using Python. It enhances my understanding of different libraries of Python i.e Flask, a light weight module for web applications.   First you will be directed to Home page, and then move to the Todo Page to view the tasks you have to done. You can Add and Remove a task as well
